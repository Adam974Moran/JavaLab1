<h1>Sunset and Sunrise</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p>This project is a light web/REST service that gives you right time of a sunrise or a sunset. The service will send GET request to the <a href="#">https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json</a> URL and then it will take sunrise and sunset times from .json file that we'll get as a response from API server.</p>
<hr>
<p>To see the results of this project you have to run server using InteliJ, then open browser or postman and put draft URL in there. Before sending request it is also important to put some values after '=' symbols to set variables.</p>
<h3>Draft URL:</h3>
<a href="#">https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/sunInfo?lat= &lng= &date= </a>
